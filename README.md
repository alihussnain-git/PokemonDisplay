# PokemonsRNApp

Welcome to PokemonsRNApp! This is a React Native application for displaying Pok√©mon details using the PokeAPI.
Task:
- Build a BroadcastReceiver that listens to USER_PRESENT Intent
- Implement a background task that runs periodically
- Everytime the background task runs, create a push notification that shows the
user how long the phone was active since the Intent was triggered.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have set up your development environment as per the [React Native environment setup guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Step 1: Start Metro Server

First, start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of your project:

```bash


yarn start

Run Your Application
Leave Metro running in its own terminal. Open a new terminal window in the project root and run your app on an Android or iOS simulator/emulator:

For Android

yarn android


For iOS

yarn ios
